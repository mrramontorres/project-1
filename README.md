Project Description: During the pandemic managing your personal relationships has become harder with everything being virtual, zoom meetings, newsfeeds, facebook, instagram, twitter; the list goes on. This project is an attempt to cut through all the noise and “be better at staying in touch” 

you to go more effectively manage who you stay in touch with and how well you staying in  stay in touch with a dashboard to remind you and track a manageable group of people

User story: I am an absent-,minded person who has lots of friends and relatives, who wants to check up on them from time to time, but keeps forgetting to. So I use the “Call your Grandma (name in progress)” App in order not to forget to check on the people I care about. When I open the app I see the list of people I like to keep track of, when I click on their name I am reminded of their important dates (birthdays, anniversaries, etc,). I can also see what sports teams and what shows they like. I can save the dates when I contact them, and send myself reminders to check up on them at certain intervals.
