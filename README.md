# project-1Project Title:  
Essential Connections

Project Description: During the pandemic managing your personal relationships has become harder with everything being virtual, zoom meetings, newsfeeds, facebook, instagram, twitter; the list goes on. This project is an attempt to cut through all the noise and “be better at staying in touch”. It also brings our attention to people who are not as present in the "virtual universe" - older relatives and friends, and people who may not have an easy access to the Internet. 

you to go more effectively manage who you stay in touch with and how well you staying in  stay in touch with a dashboard to remind you and track a manageable group of people

User story: I am an absent-minded person who has lots of friends and relatives, who wants to check up on them from time to time, but keeps forgetting to. So I use the Essential Connections App in order not to forget to check on the people I care about. When I open the app I see the list of people I like to keep track of, when I click on their name I am reminded of their important dates (birthdays, anniversaries, etc,). I can also see what what they like, what their interests are and other important facts, which otherwise skip my memory.

I also somtimes use the emergency contacts page, which encourages me to have important contact iformation at hand before I actually need it.

Finally, I use the recipe page to write down cherished family recipes, before they get lost.
