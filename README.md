Essential Connections

Project Description: During the pandemic managing your personal relationships has become harder with everything being virtual, zoom meetings, newsfeeds, facebook, instagram, twitter; the list goes on. This project is an attempt to cut through all the noise and be better at staying in touch. And especially, staying in touch with people, who may be for various reasons not as present in our digital universe. We invite our users to create a discerningly curated list of important connections, that is manageable and focused. 


User story: I am an absent-minded person who has lots of friends and relatives, who wants to check up on them from time to time, but keeps forgetting to. So I use the “Essential Connections” App in order not to forget to check on the people I care about. When I open the app I create the list of people I like to keep track of, when I click on their name I am reminded of their important dates (birthdays, anniversaries, etc,). In addtion, I can create a list of emergency contacts, before I actually need them. Finally, there is a list of family recipes, gathered in one place.
